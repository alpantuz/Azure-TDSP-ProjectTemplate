The Orange Telecom company in France is one of the largest operators of mobile and internet services in Europe and Africa and a global 
leader in corporate telecommunication services. They have 256 million customers worldwide. They have significant coverage in France,

in any company. Orange would like to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services 
(appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling). For this effort, they think churn 
is the first thing they would like to focus on.
